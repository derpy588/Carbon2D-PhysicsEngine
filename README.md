# Carbon2D

**This is currently a work in progress and is not finished yet.**
I plan to have this project finished by the end of the semester along with my AI Project.

- [ ] Friction & Damping(Air Resistence)
- [ ] User Input Controls
    - [ ] Pause/Unpause
    - [ ] Change Simulation Speed
    - [ ] Add object
    - [ ] Apply forces to object
- [ ] Complete GUI with SFML
    - [ ] Step Counter
    - [ ] Elapsed Time
    - [ ] Simulation Speed
