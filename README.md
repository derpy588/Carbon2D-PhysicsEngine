# Carbon2D

**This is currently a work in progress and is not finished yet.**
I plan to have this project finished by the end of the semester along with my AI Project.

Side Note: School and everything has been taking more time than I thought and I am not so sure I will be able to finish this in time. The research of this project is also taking more time than I planned. However, I still plan to try to finish this by the end of the semester.
